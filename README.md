# PCSO Lotto Checker

Offline iPhone web app for checking PCSO 6-number lotto bets
(6/42, 6/45, 6/49, 6/55, 6/58) against the official winning numbers.

**Live:** https://nlacap.github.io/PCSO-Lotto-Checker/
Current version is shown in the page footer (v2.2.1).

▶ **[How-to video](https://nlacap.github.io/PCSO-Lotto-Checker/docs/how-to-use.mp4)** (80 s) — also linked
from the app footer. It walks through every step below with the real app.

## Using it on iPhone

1. **Pick the game and draw date.**
2. **Enter your bets** (up to 6) — any of:
   - type the numbers (the cursor jumps to the next box automatically),
   - tap **SELECT ON NUMBER BOARD**,
   - open **📷 Scan or paste your ticket**, tap the box, choose **Scan Text**, point the camera
     at the ticket, then **FILL BETS**.
3. **Get the winning numbers** — any of:
   - open **📋 Scan or paste PCSO results**, paste the results table, tap **SAVE RESULTS**
     (see below),
   - paste all six at once (e.g. `05-12-23-34-40-41`) into the first winning box,
   - type them or use the board.
4. Tap **COMPARE ALL BETS**. Each bet shows its matches and prize tier (3, 4, 5 or 6 numbers).

Everything is saved automatically on the phone and works offline once loaded.
Add it to the Home Screen from Safari's Share menu for an app-like icon.

### Saving official PCSO results

1. On pcso.gov.ph, open the lotto results search and find the draw.
2. Either select and **Copy** the results table in Safari, **or** take a screenshot, open it in
   Photos, press and hold on the text, select all, and **Copy**.
   Include the **DRAW DATE** column if you can.
3. In the checker, open **📋 Scan or paste PCSO results**, paste, tap **SAVE RESULTS**.

What happens:

- Every 6/42–6/58 row is read and checked; 2D/3D/4D/6D rows are skipped.
- Results are stored **on this phone only** (newest 60 draws per game).
- Picking a game + draw date fills the winning numbers from a saved result.
- Numbers you typed are never overwritten — if they differ, a **USE SAVED PCSO RESULT** button appears.
- The **Latest saved results** list under the paste box is tappable: it switches to that game and draw.
- If the pasted text has no draw date (e.g. the date column was cut off), results are saved under
  the app's Draw Date and a warning asks you to confirm it — PCSO's search-box date is not always
  the draw date.

Always confirm a winning ticket with PCSO before claiming a prize.

## Validation rules

- Each box accepts digits only; letters, signs and decimals are stripped as you type.
- Out-of-range and duplicate numbers turn red immediately, with a message under the row.
- Compare checks the draw date, the winning numbers and every bet, and lists **all** problems at once.
  Valid bets are still checked when another bet has an error.
- Warnings (not blocking): draw date in the future, date not on the game's usual draw day
  (silenced when a saved official result exists for that date), two identical bets.
- Scanned/pasted tickets and results are validated line by line; rejected lines are listed, never
  silently kept.
- Saved data is checked and repaired on load; damaged data is reset with a backup copy kept
  (`pcso-lotto-checker-v1.backup`). Save failures (Private Browsing, storage full) are shown, not hidden.

## Project structure

Data on the phone (localStorage):

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `pcso-lotto-checker-v1` | bets, winning numbers and draw date per game |
| `pcso-lotto-checker-v1.backup` | copy of damaged data, if it ever had to be reset |
| `pcso-lotto-results-v1` | saved official PCSO results |

## Development

```
npm test        # 33 unit tests, also run by GitHub Actions on every push
```

To preview locally, serve the folder over HTTP (ES modules don't load from `file://`):

```
python3 -m http.server 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000
```

### Updating the how-to video

After UI changes, regenerate it so it matches the app (needs Playwright + Chromium and ffmpeg):

```
python3 docs/make-video.py
```

The script drives the real app at iPhone size with demo data, adds captions and tap markers,
and writes `docs/how-to-use.mp4`. The iPhone *Scan Text* camera step can't be recorded, so the
video shows the scanned text appearing in the box.

### Releasing

1. Bump `APP_VERSION` in `js/config.js` (shown in the footer).
2. Bump `CACHE` in `sw.js`, and add any new file to its `ASSETS` list.
3. Push to `main`; GitHub Pages updates within a minute or two. On the phone, reload once.
